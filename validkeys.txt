# This example file contains key/value definitions
# It can optionally be read *before* reading the actual
# settings file (e.g. test.txt), as a means of defining
# valid(expected) keys. If this is done, and any keys
# that don't exist in this file are encountered in the
# settings file, an Excpetion will be thrown.
# The format of this file is key/values, where the values
# are treated as strings that can (TODO) be used as additional
# optional descriptors of the corresponding keys.
